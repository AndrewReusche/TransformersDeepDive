    "\n",
    "🤗 Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing AI datasets for Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load a dataset in a single line of code, and use our powerful data processing and streaming methods to quickly get your dataset ready for training in a deep learning model. Backed by the Apache Arrow format, process large datasets with zero-copy reads without any memory constraints for optimal speed and efficiency. We also feature a deep integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing you to easily load and share a dataset with the wider machine learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find your dataset today on the Hugging Face Hub, and take an in-depth look inside of it with the live viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorials\n",
    "Learn the basics and become familiar with loading, accessing, and processing a dataset. Start here if you are using 🤗 Datasets for the first time!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How-to guides\n",
    "Practical guides to help you achieve a specific goal. Take a look at these guides to learn how to use 🤗 Datasets to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual guides\n",
    "High-level explanations for building a better understanding about important topics such as the underlying data format, the cache, and how datasets are generated.\n",
